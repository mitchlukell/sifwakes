                <div class="paragraph">I was born to a city with neither the time nor space to support one more demanding life. To right the imbalance, a malfunction in one of Dredge's <em>anbaric</em> harvesting towers led it and the neighbourhood of wooden shacks that I called home to catch fire and burn to cinders within minutes. I was the only one of my family to survive; my friends and I had gone down to the river to poke a body washed up on the shore with a long stick. I remember its bloated, blotchy skin, and sitting by the waters' edge and watching as the inferno blazed through the Eastway, from stack to shop to tavern, before snaking back up the <em>anbaric</em> tower to create a crackling scar against the sky.
    So began my story. If anyone cared to ask for it. It happened, in the sense that it is based on a true event in the history of Dredge, one I read about on an evening of idle leafing through the infinite knowledge and learning that still continues to dwell in the Grand Library. It is not, however, <strong>my</strong> truth; I am as close to knowing that at the end of my life as I was all those years ago. It is only now that I make any effort to find the beginning, and even then at Old Ben's urging. Several times I have begun, and each time in a different place. Julio would have suggested beginning with a history of Dredge itself, of dates and events laid our neatly, one after the next. Qanto would have had no patience for such things. I can hear her rough voice now, urging me to get to the exciting stuff. "People want escape from their lives," she would say, "not to be dragged back into them."
    One day I accepted what I had known all along. I meant to write Sif's story, and knew it should start with him, and so I wrote the sentence that begins my tale. I resolved to begin at the beginning, and follow my tale to its end, faithful to the winding paths that led me to a parapet looking out over the sea, having brought <span class="annotation">[JJ2]</span> death back to the world.</div>
    
    <div class="chapter-title">1.</div>
    
    <div class="paragraph">Physical details come first. Rough shingle against my cheek. Water lapping at my feet. Taste comes next, and smell. Thick, brown sand on my tongue, and the green tang of seaweed. My sight is the last to return, or, rather, the lack of it; my eyes are shut tight. <em>Not now, world</em>, they seem to say.
    I roll onto my back. Stinging whiteness flares against my eyelids. I threw an arm over my face. <em>One moment longer.</em>
    Darkness begins to creep back in.
    But the body wants to live.
    All at once, my senses descend upon my consciousness. My eyes fly open, and my body propels itself upright as my lungs convulse in great spasms for air.
    So I return to the world of the living.
    For a very long time I sit, staring at the world. Wind and sand stretch to the horizon. Gulls circle above, <em>caw</em>ing in dismay. A few more passes, then they wheel away, searching for the jellies of less mobile eyes.
    "You're lucky to be alive."
    I turn my head. An old man sits on a rickety chair, just above the high-tide mark. His face is weathered and lined by years out of doors. A hut, the paint peeling and faded, sags behind him.
    "I thought to help, but," he makes a vague movement, "I thought it best you went back to the sea. Seems you came from there anyway."
    I open my mouth. A dry rasp croaks from my lips.
    "How long have I been here?" My voice is deep, fully-formed by a decade of change.
    "I've been here since sunrise." The old man peers at the horizon, as though to see beyond its lazy curve. I follow it, but find only sea and shimmer where the water meets the sky.
    ‚ÄúI was on a ship, crossing the Wide Sea via the city of Dredge.‚Äù
    ‚ÄúNot crossing much of anything now.‚Äù 
    Another wave crashes against the beach. When it recedes, a curved piece of metal lies glinting in the sunshine. One end is mangled, sharp and twisted.
    The old man nods. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve found your ship.‚Äù
    I frown. How much scrap and detritus littered the world‚Äôs oceans? But I have no other explanation for how I came to be here. I glance skywards as if in search of an answer. The deep blue above gazes impassively back. 
    I look back at the warped metal. I once heard how shipwrights stamped their initials onto their work as marks of their trade; my eyes move in search of any such markings now, but there is nothing. I reach out a hand- 
    The tip of my index finger is missing. 
    A pause. Then, no it isn‚Äôt, says a disbelieving voice at the back of my mind. 
    I hold my hand close to my face. My eyes aren‚Äôt lying ‚Äì an impossibly fine cut has been made just below where the nail should be.     I run my thumb against it, but there is no pain. The skin is perfectly healed. 
    I sit back in the sand. How did this happen? When? My eye returns to the jagged piece of metal before me. I turn it over in my hands. A set of numbers and a word, rendered in an industrial fashion, appear on the underside:
