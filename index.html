<h2 class="chapter-title">Before</h2>
<div class="novel-text" id="novelText">
<div class="paragraph">I was born to a city with neither the time nor space to support one more demanding life. To right the imbalance, a malfunction in one of Dredge's <em>anbaric</em> harvesting towers led it and the neighbourhood of wooden shacks that I called home to catch fire and burn to cinders within minutes. I was the only one of my family to survive; my friends and I had gone down to the river to poke a body washed up on the shore with a long stick. I remember its bloated, blotchy skin, and sitting by the waters' edge and watching as the inferno blazed through the Eastway, from stack to shop to tavern, before snaking back up the <em>anbaric</em> tower to create a crackling scar against the sky.
So began my story. If anyone cared to ask for it. It happened, in the sense that it is based on a true event in the history of Dredge, one I read about on an evening of idle leafing through the infinite knowledge and learning that still continues to dwell in the Grand Library. It is not, however, <strong>my</strong> truth; I am as close to knowing that at the end of my life as I was all those years ago. It is only now that I make any effort to find the beginning, and even then at Old Ben's urging. Several times I have begun, and each time in a different place. Julio would have suggested beginning with a history of Dredge itself, of dates and events laid our neatly, one after the next. Qanto would have had no patience for such things. I can hear her rough voice now, urging me to get to the exciting stuff. "People want escape from their lives," she would say, "not to be dragged back into them."
One day I accepted what I had known all along. I meant to write Sif's story, and knew it should start with him, and so I wrote the sentence that begins my tale. I resolved to begin at the beginning, and follow my tale to its end, faithful to the winding paths that led me to a parapet looking out over the sea, having brought death back to the world.</div>
    
<div class="chapter-title">1.</div>
    
<div class="paragraph">Physical details come first. Rough shingle against my cheek. Water lapping at my feet. Taste comes next, and smell. Thick, brown sand on my tongue, and the green tang of seaweed. My sight is the last to return, or, rather, the lack of it; my eyes are shut tight. <em>Not now, world</em>, they seem to say.
I roll onto my back. Stinging whiteness flares against my eyelids. I threw an arm over my face. <em>One moment longer.</em>
Darkness begins to creep back in.
But the body wants to live.
All at once, my senses descend upon my consciousness. My eyes fly open, and my body propels itself upright as my lungs convulse in great spasms for air.
So I return to the world of the living.
For a very long time I sit, staring at the world. Wind and sand stretch to the horizon. Gulls circle above, <em>caw</em>ing in dismay. A few more passes, then they wheel away, searching for the jellies of less mobile eyes.
"You're lucky to be alive."
I turn my head. An old man sits on a rickety chair, just above the high-tide mark. His face is weathered and lined by years out of doors. A hut, the paint peeling and faded, sags behind him.
"I thought to help, but," he makes a vague movement, "I thought it best you went back to the sea. Seems you came from there anyway."
I open my mouth. A dry rasp croaks from my lips.
"How long have I been here?" My voice is deep, fully-formed by a decade of change.
"I've been here since sunrise." The old man peers at the horizon, as though to see beyond its lazy curve. I follow it, but find only sea and shimmer where the water meets the sky.
‚ÄúI was on a ship, crossing the Wide Sea via the city of Dredge.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot crossing much of anything now.‚Äù 
Another wave crashes against the beach. When it recedes, a curved piece of metal lies glinting in the sunshine. One end is mangled, sharp and twisted.
The old man nods. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve found your ship.‚Äù
I frown. How much scrap and detritus littered the world‚Äôs oceans? But I have no other explanation for how I came to be here. I glance skywards as if in search of an answer. The deep blue above gazes impassively back. 
I look back at the warped metal. I once heard how shipwrights stamped their initials onto their work as marks of their trade; my eyes move in search of any such markings now, but there is nothing. I reach out a hand- 
The tip of my index finger is missing. 
A pause. Then, no it isn‚Äôt, says a disbelieving voice at the back of my mind. 
I hold my hand close to my face. My eyes aren‚Äôt lying ‚Äì an impossibly fine cut has been made just below where the nail should be.     I run my thumb against it, but there is no pain. The skin is perfectly healed. 
I sit back in the sand. How did this happen? When? My eye returns to the jagged piece of metal before me. I turn it over in my hands. A set of numbers and a word, rendered in an industrial fashion, appear on the underside: 
        
SK.2254.50 
SKY KRAKEN

The numbers mean nothing, but I know the words as I know the beating of my heart. 
‚ÄúI was Mate on the Kraken.‚Äù I mutter to no-one. 
‚ÄúNo-one‚Äôs Mate, now.‚Äù
A pulse of warmth flushes through my body, driving me to my feet. 
‚ÄúWhere am I? I don‚Äôt recognise this land.‚Äù 
The old man‚Äôs face is still, as though debating the answer. Then, ‚ÄúDredge,‚Äù he says.  
Dredge. I cast my eye along the beach; as if on cue, a red line, arrow-straight and dancing in the heat, appears on the northern horizon. Nature doesn‚Äôt deal in straight lines.
The sound of spitting, crackling flames comes to my senses. The gentle warmth of the sun cupping my cheek intensifies to a glow that prickles my skin. The image of a woman appears before me, and her features are thrown into deep shadow. She seizes my arm. ‚ÄúWhatever happens,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúfind Salvador. Get to Dredge.‚Äù 
It is a memory. I replay it in my mind, the heat on my face and the groaning, buckling ship beneath my feet. I am aboard the Kraken, and a blazing inferno is licking through the envelope. Rogue strike, I tell myself, must have been. The Kraken is an anbarmachinen, an airship designed for one purpose ‚Äì to get hit by lightning. Each strike is converted into anbaric power and stored in vast batteries, which are sold on the mainland. It is dangerous work; every anbarnaut I know has their own story of rogue strikes, the moment when a ship‚Äôs  lightning conductors receive multiple strikes simultaneously, leading to an overload of power that, and, in the worst instances, fire. And fire, at ten thousand feet about sea-level, is the most terrifying thing of all. 
I come back to the beach. My body has carried me away from the old man and his hut.  Something hot and heavy snatches at a trailing foot ‚Äì it is another steel girder, as tall as a man, driven deep into the sand. A fluttering motion draws my eye to a flapping scrap of canvas, and from there to a scene of destruction my brain fails to comprehend. Smashed glass, glittering like sugar. Splintered boxes and crates. And in the distance the frame of an airship, lying like the burnt bones of some ancient beast. There was no mistaking it, for there was nothing larger in all the Mechant Fleet - it was the Kraken. 
I watch as my ship is claimed by the waves. My ship. When I became an anbarnaut I signed myself up to ten years‚Äô service, relinquishing all claim to possessions and responsibilities unrelated to the running of the ship to which I was posted. I do not know how old I was when I signed up for my first ‚Äòturn‚Äô, as anbarnaut‚Äôs called it, but I knew that I was a year into my second. At least half of my life had been dedicated to the Kraken;  now, I was watching it all slip away, trying hard not think that a piece of myself was going with it, never to return. 
Get to Dredge. The woman‚Äôs words echo in my head, and I am dragged back into the memory. Acrid smoke stings my nostrils. The floor vibrates violently, as if the engines are rattling themselves to pieces. A sudden explosion rocks the ship, and I put an arm out to steady myself, but the woman before me remains unmoved, as though suspended in the air. ‚ÄúGet to Dredge,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúfind Salvador. Give this to him.‚Äù She pushes a cylinder into my hand. It is smooth, and oddly cold. I stow it in an inside pocket, as a spout of flame gouts somewhere behind me. For a moment my immediate surroundings are cast in bright illumination. My eyes flicker to where the woman‚Äôs face should be, but there is only a devouring darkness from which nothing escapes. 
I return to the beach. I am standing at the waters‚Äô edge, the wreckage of the Kraken behind me. Something heavy moves against my chest. I reach into my pocket and withdrew the cylinder. How long has it been there? Engraved handles, like ornate door-knobs, bind each end. I grasp one, and begin to twis- 
GET TO DREDGE. 
The woman‚Äôs voice is a scream. I cry out, and the cylinder leaps from my hands, falling to lodge in the sand at my feet. 
The voice smashes itself into silence. The cylinder lies perfectly still, but the air around seems to pulse with energy. My heart pounds with it, and a tingling sensation dances on the tips of my fingers. Find Salvador. I know what I need to do, and I knew, too, that a part of me wondered why, but every time the thought began to cross my mind, something rose to push it back down again. Give this to him. My hand trembles as I take up the cylinder and return it to my pocket. My heart settles, and stillness sits across my shoulders. 
I know what I have to do. I know where I need to go. Whatever came after, well, I would worry about that then. 
A gap in the dunes backing onto the beach beckon me inland. A patchwork world of fields and rolling farmland lie beyond, with a road winding its way through the haze into the horizon. I hesitate, caught between the memory and waking up on the beach. The space between them is like a lurch through time, like missing a step on a swaying ship. I do not ask what happened in those between hours; the fate of the Kraken had been written, and couldn‚Äôt concern me ‚Äì it is the damage that had caused my body to erase all memory of those hours that terrifies me. 
You‚Äôre pushing yourself too hard, I try to remind myself. You‚Äôve been through something big, so big that you cannot, maybe will not ever, recall the details. 
But what if it‚Äôs still happening. Will I remember this tomorrow? 
I drag my tongue over my teeth. I‚Äôve never gotten anywhere by standing still. Get to Dredge. My voice, not hers this time. I nod in self-affirmation and descend into the waving fields, distracting myself from the insistent tingle in my fingers by trailing my hands through the brittle, fragrant crop.
